# Secret-Santa-Code-Challange
This is the code for part 1 of the Secret Santa Code Challange.

Make sure your IDE is set to handle java 1.8 otherwise you'll get warnings regarding some of the functions and arrow notations.


Part 3 notes:

Famlies are all on the same line of the text file.
This version handles parsing out close family as follows:

Kirk Spock Bones
James Angel Bill.

Kirk Spock and Bones would all be parsed as being part of the same family. While James Angel and Bill would be part of their own family.
